# FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Projects

This repository contains projects I completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

## Certification Overview

The certification focuses on teaching the fundamental skills for analyzing and visualizing data using Python. Topics include:

- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Cleaning and normalizing datasets
- Creating meaningful insights through data analysis

## Projects

Here are the five projects required to complete the certification:

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
   - A Python script that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a 3x3 matrix.
   - [Project Code](./mean_variance_standard_deviation_calculator.py)

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
   - An analysis of demographic data from a CSV file to calculate statistics about the population.
   - [Project Code](./demographic_data_analyzer.py)

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
   - A visualization project analyzing medical examination data using bar plots, categorical plots, and heatmaps.
   - [Project Code](./medical_data_visualizer.py)

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
   - Visualization of time series data from FreeCodeCamp forums, creating line charts, bar charts, and box plots.
   - [Project Code](./time_series_visualizer.py)

5. **Sea Level Predictor**
   - A project that predicts sea level rise using historical data and linear regression.
   - [Project Code](./sea_level_predictor.py)

## Installation

To run these projects locally, ensure you have Python installed and follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KingTroy125/freecodecamp-data-analysis
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd freecodecamp-data-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each project contains a Python script with functions and a test file to validate the implementation. To run a project:

1. Execute the Python script:

   ```bash
   python <project_file_name>.py
   ```

2. Run tests to verify correctness:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_module.py
   ```
